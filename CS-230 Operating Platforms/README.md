   - Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is developing an application called Draw It or Lose It.  The game is currently only available on Android, but the team wants to expand availability through a web-based version.   As such, consideration must be made to multiple user environments from desktop to mobile when designing the user interface and support functionality.  Multiple teams with multiple players can participate in a single game, but only one instance of any given game will exist at one time.


   - What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think the initial documentation of the project was my stronger work in this project.   Summarizing and outlining the requirements and design constraints from the customer’s description of their needs was particularly important.  I also felt comfortable describing the UML class model and how they exemplified object-oriented principles.


      - What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Having a well-made UML diagram makes programming much easier. Seeing a visual representation of how the entities are related and what services are connected with their characteristics and behaviors laid out helps keep the programming ordered and efficient.


   - If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I felt least comfortable with my recommendations section.  I need to spend more time understanding the different architectures and how they might meet the client’s needs


   - How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
A major consideration was their need for their application to run on multiple platforms in a distributed environment.  Understanding these needs impacted how they would develop the program and informed what operating environments would be best.


   - How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Using UML diagrams is key to designing complex software.  Taking the time to map out how software interacts and what each component needs to contain saves time and makes programming more efficient and elegant.  In addition to class diagrams, process diagrams make the logic of the program clearer to understand and reduces redundant code.
