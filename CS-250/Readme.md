•	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs begins with direct discussion.  Asking probing questions and using concrete products as examples is important.  But ultimately, working deliverables with each sprint will be the best gauge of how well needs have been interpreted.  User stories incorporate the user’s perspective into the design so developers don’t just look at a list of requirements, they think about what the end result will be from the perspective of the end user.

•	How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I feel like I embrace the sprint methodology already, somewhat to a fault as I don’t always map out my program before I dive in- I get something working, then improve upon it.  This can lead to major overhauls as I go along and understand the requirements better.  I hope to incorporate information radiators and Kanban boards as a way to keep projects organized and communicate with my team members.

•	What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Even more important than delivering a good product to the customer is developing good working relationships with your team.  Projects come and go, and to an extent so do co-workers, but in a strong organization, team members will stick around.  It’s worth investing in those relationships to be able to deliver a good product.
