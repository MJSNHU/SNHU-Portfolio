   - Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass wanted to build a web-based system that allowed customers to make reservations for driving tests, browse course material, and take tests online.  They also wanted to be able to capture and analyze various data points about the users and the system without having to worry about security or backup processes.


   - What did you do particularly well?

I think I interpreted the client’s needs from the interview well and translated them into UML diagrams the best.  


   - If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would go back to the Business Design Document.  The Platform constraints are hard for me to visualize.


   - How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user’s needs directly impacted the system design, particularly in their desire to have security and back up services provided by a host platform, rather than detracting from their focus on the content and reservation system.  This saved a lot of time not having to consider the infrastructure required for all the hardware and storage required, the software needed to run it, or the actors needing to maintain it.


   - How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Creating UML diagrams to help visualize the flow and structure of the program and entities in it is a major part of designing software.  The same is true for designing a physical or logical system.  Being able to focus on parts without losing site of the whole helps integration.  And diagrams help keep track of the whole.
