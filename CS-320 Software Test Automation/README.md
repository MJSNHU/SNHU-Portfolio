   - How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Desigining tests to ensure code meets specifications will ensure it is functional.  For example, if an function argument requires an integer, try calling it with a string and test the outcome.  This can tell you how you need to accept or process input.  Good coding practices like encapsulation will also help security.

   - How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

It's often not enough to simply translate written requirements into code- this can often lead to unhandled exceptions or security gaps.  One has to design with the end use case in mind and beyond- the internet was originally only a few terminals behind locked doors accessed by a few individuals.  Software security was a far second thought after physical security. A product may have life beyond its current use- incorporating best programming practices are always a good idea regardless of how limited an appplication might be planned to be used.

   - How do I approach designing software?

Careful consideration of the requirements is the first step.  Understanding the customer's needs is important as well.  Putting myself in the end-user's shoes and thinking about how they might interact with what I'm building either on purpose or by accident that wasn't discussed in the requirements helps to determine how a program should fail sucessfully, which in many appications may be more just as important as running sucessfully.
