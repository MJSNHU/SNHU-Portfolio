1.    How do I approach designing software?
       - What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
    Graphic design was completely new to me before taking this course.  I learned about making complex objects out of basic shapes, camera view points, texturing and lighting techniques. 
       - What design process did you follow for your project work?
    Incremental building and testing was critical to this project.  Focusing on one shape, one texture, one light at at time allowed me to build a complete and full scene. Organizing code into logical segments based on where the objects were to be placed on screen helped find lines I needed to change quickly. 
       - How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
    Placing like code together when it doesn't interrupt the flow of the program, not just separating them into function but arranging it together within functions makes it more readable and makes it quicker to find what needs to be changed.
    The ability to review existing complex code to see how to use and adapt it to solve new problems is a skill that can't be practiced enough.  
2.    How do I approach developing programs?
       - What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
    I like to start with the main program to try to understand the most of the control flow before diving into other source files.  That way I know which source files to focus on and when they're being called.  This helps piece together the order of events and allowed me to understand when things were occurring.
       - How did iteration factor into your development?
    As mentioned above, incremental building and testing was critical.  Trying to visualize how the 3D world was translated into 2D space was very difficult, but changing the x coordinate until I got it in place, then changing the y, then changing the z for example allowed me to slowly get the objects where I wanted them.  
       - How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
    Feedback to the milestones was crucial.  I had a couple of aha moments; when it finally clicked that that shapes were placed according to their center instead of their bottom vertices it was much easier to place them were I wanted to in the scene with minimal scratch paper math.  Remembering to slow down and read the requirements carefully as well before jumping into coding is a lesson I'm still learning, but each class it gets reiterated a little more. 
3.    How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
       - How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
      Focusing on one piece at a time.  Performing all the complex mathematics in separate encapsulated source files allows the programmer to better visualize program flow and logic.
