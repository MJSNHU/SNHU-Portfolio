- How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Following the principles of encapsulation and abstraction are helpful.  In these projects, each layer of the stack- database, API and dashboard could be abstracted away when focusing on other layers.  This allows attention to separate functionality in each phase. The CRUD module could be used to build other dashboard functionality, or even manipulate the database itself.

- How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniqu
es or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

After identifying the problem, research ways in which similar challenges have been overcome, then present the consumer with recommended solutions. Other than being Python based, using dash was an entirely new experience for me.  Understanding decorators and callbacks took some time, as well as establishing inputs and outputs for them. In the  future, I'd take an iterative approach, checking in frequently with the client to ensure their needs are being met.

- What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientist is a broad term that covers a range of jobs from network design to software development to research to computer engineering and more.  Their work is important because it provides solutions to many different challenges in today's information age. This type of project allows a company like Grazioso Salvare to visualize the raw data and use that information to make business decisions.
