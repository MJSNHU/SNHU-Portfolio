    Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this project, much of the initialization of the and the two python classes were given.  I was tasked with implementing the Q-Training Algorithm.  Starting with a for each epoch loop, the agent was randomly assigned a valid (non-0) cell in the map.  Then the agent would choose either to move randomly or from its learned experience based on a random choice compared to the epsilon.  Next, the game would record the episode in its experience learning.  This was repeated until the game ended in a win or lose state.  If the win rate was more than 90%, the game checked if it was 100% and output how many epochs it took. 

    Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

        What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists do a wide range of work in the information and technology fields ranging from data computation to application development, machine learning to cyber security.  Today most societies depend on computers for any number of day-to-day tasks.  Computer scientists are responsible for developing interfaces between information and technology and the people who need it.  They are also responsible for ensuring the data is protected and available.  Finally, they move technological capabilities forward through research and study.

        How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

Perhaps the hardest and most important part of solving a problem is defining it in terms of scope and outcome.  Software design and development has a lot of moving parts interwoven together, and it can be easy for designers to creep away from the customer’s needs.  That said, customer are rarely able to communicate their needs in technical terms so it is on the design team to help flush them out so the developers have a roadmap.  Equally importantly, programs still tend to be garbage-in, garbage-out machines meaning if the information is invalid, the output is unpredictable.  

        What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

The end user deserves a safe, secure device or application that does what it’s expected to do.  Additional features, such as datamining, which may be necessary for the success of the product but not necessarily transparent to the user should be disclosed.  User agreements should be clear, straightforward, and brief.
